Having started my career in the 3rd year of university, I have already gained almost 5 years of experience in producing robust code for high-volume companies as a software engineer.  In addition, I am always happy to help others, to teach them something new, so after graduation I worked for a while as a teacher at my university. It is very important for me to work on solving complex and unusual tasks, to actively communicate with the team, to make decisions together that will allow us to build a quality product.
