I've started my software engineer career at the 4th year of university and at the moment I have already gained almost 5 years of experience in developing robust code for huge companies.
As a software engineer I am always focused on solving problems and challenges that will help the company grow and improve performance.
It is very important for me to work on solving complex and unusual tasks, to actively communicate with the team and stakeholders, to make decisions together that will allow us to build a high quality product.
