& OZON.ru is a leading e-commerce platform in CIS. Currently I'm developing services for the Catalog \& Search system that is used by millions of people a day. 
Mostly working on supporting new product features which directly influence user experience.\\
& Main achievements: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Participated in the launch of a new product - OZON Express - grocery delivery in 15 minutes. Supported new search context in catalog services
\item Replaced search by warehouses with a search by geolocations and delivery polygons which reduced the amount of data transmitted over the network by hundreds of times
\item Developed new low latency category tree service that stores tree in memory refreshing it periodically and could be easily scaled without influence on external systems

\end{itemize} \\
